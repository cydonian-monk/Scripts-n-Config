# Scripts-n-Config
==================
## The ReadMe File

A collection of ~~bash~~ scripts and config files I've written over the years.

This is a whole mess of things that I don't even want to start to describe. If you're watching this repo then I have some concerns. Ha ha. When I first created this repo I was using Gentoo Linux as my daily driver; shortly after that I moved back into Appleland, and have been using a mix of OS-X/MacOS/Linux/Windows/whatever ever since. 

Some ~~deprived~~ well-meaning soul back around 2012 suggested that everyone should have a repo like this, just in case everything blew up and you needed to fallback to an off-site copy. Plus it gave your github some "fluff" and maybe looked good during an interview. Who knows if any of that was ever true, but it does *occasionally* help. It's also no replacement for a good backup policy.

The old README for this repo listed every file and gave a description. I'm not doing that here. Any scripts that are in this repo will have descriptions in the file or just be so simple that their function is obvious. And config files will be, well, config files. IDK what else to say.

Folders are generally organized by the system the file was created on. Some will be generic to the device type. Some won't be. Some won't make sense. That might be by design or it might be because I'm only doing this because somebody over a decade ago suggested it might be a good idea.

Good luck and may the zsh be with you.

 I recently rebuilt the Gentoo system on my AMD netbook, and decided I needed
 more backup options for my bash scripts and config files. Thus this update. 
 Also included are a few new files. New to you, since this is a new github
 repo....

 These scripts are distributed with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY, and are not 
 distributed under any license.  Most of these are so simple and obvious that 
 copyright probably couldn't even be claimed.  If you really want to pick a 
 copyright fight about one or all of these scripts, you can have them.
 
 These scripts are distributed in the hope they will be helpful.  If they
 prove to be less than helpful, or cause a synthetic uprising, you and
 you alone are to blame.  If you use one of these scripts and manage to 
 blow up your system, don't come crying to me.  Do not taunt these scripts.

 I'll add more to this as I dig through my archives.  Many of the advances 
 in the Linux desktop in recent years have obsoleted many of my scripts.
 Likewise with the config files.  Obviously specific hardware makes many of
 them useless to you.
